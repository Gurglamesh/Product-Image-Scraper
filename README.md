## Key Features

### Comprehensive Scraping
The extension goes beyond simple `<img>` tags. It scans for images within **`srcset` attributes**, **CSS backgrounds**, **JSON-LD metadata**, and even raw `<script>` tags to find every possible product shot.

### Smart URL Transformation
It uses a set of configurable rules to intelligently guess high-resolution image URLs from thumbnails. For example, it can transform `.../product/100x100/image.jpg` into `.../product/1600x900/image.jpg` or remove query parameters like `?w=150`.

### Image Processing & Normalization
All downloaded images are processed for **consistency**. Each image is centered within a **1000x1000 pixel white canvas** and saved as a **high-quality JPEG**. This ensures all your final images have a uniform size and format.

### Intelligent Filtering & Deduplication

* **Heuristic Background Removal:** An optional feature attempts to automatically remove plain white backgrounds from product shots, making them transparent before placing them on the final white canvas.
* **Duplicate Detection:** The extension calculates a **hash** of each processed image to avoid saving visually identical duplicates, even if they come from different URLs (e.g., a `.png` and a `.jpg` of the same image).
* **Size Filtering:** Users can opt to only see images that meet a minimum size threshold, filtering out small icons and thumbnails.

### User-Friendly Interface
The popup provides a clear grid of all found images. Users can easily select the images they want, and a counter keeps track of the selection. The order in which images are selected determines their final filename (e.g., `01_product-name.jpg`, `02_product-name.jpg`).

### Advanced Customization
For tricky websites, users can provide their own **Custom CSS Selectors**. Images found within these selectors are given top priority, ensuring the extension always pulls from the main product gallery first.

### Domain-Specific Activation
The extension only runs on websites you **explicitly enable** it on. This respects user privacy and saves system resources. It can also be configured to open its popup automatically when you visit an enabled site.

## How It Works

1.  **Navigate** to a product page on an e-commerce site.
2.  **Click** the extension icon in your browser's toolbar.
3.  **Activate the Extension:** In the popup's toolbar, check the box labeled **"Aktivera p√• [domain name]"** (Enable on...). This only needs to be done once per domain. The popup will then reload and start searching for images.
4.  **Review and Filter:** The popup will display all the images it found. You can use the filter checkboxes at the top to refine the results, such as **"Visa endast stora bilder"** (Show only large images) or **"D√∂lj dubbletter"** (Hide duplicates).
5.  **Select Images:** Click on the images you want to download. A blue border and a number will appear, indicating the selection and its order. You can use the **"Markera alla"** (Select All) and **"Avmarkera alla"** (Deselect All) buttons for convenience.
6.  **Download:** Click the blue **"Spara valda"** (Save Selected) button.
7.  **Done!** üéâ The extension will process each selected image and save them into a new folder named after the product (e.g., `Awesome T-Shirt/01_Awesome T-Shirt.jpg`).

## Installing for Development/Testing (Firefox)

If you want to test a development branch or install the extension directly from the source code, you can load it as a **temporary add-on** in Firefox.

1.  **Download the Source Code:** Download the project files as a `.zip` file and extract them to a folder on your computer.
2.  **Open Firefox** and navigate to the following URL: `about:debugging`
3.  **Navigate to Add-ons:** In the left-hand sidebar, click on **"This Firefox"**.
4.  **Load the Add-on:** Click the **"Load Temporary Add-on..."** button.
5.  **Select the Manifest:** A file dialog will open. Navigate into the folder where you extracted the source code and select the **`manifest.json`** file.

The extension will now be installed and active.

> **Note:** Temporary add-ons are only active until you close Firefox. You will need to repeat this process every time you restart the browser.
